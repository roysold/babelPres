hi orel

run "npm start" on this project
and then in sources > bundle.js, search for "shirchen", and you will see that all the occurences of "whoIsQueenOfGit" have been changed to "shirchen".
I wrote a plugin that changes all occurences of whoIsQueenOfGit to shirchen in bundle.js.
I probably didn't do it in the best way but it works.

i forgot my git password...
